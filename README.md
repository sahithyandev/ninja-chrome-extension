# Ninja - Chrome Extension

Ninja is a chrome extension which focuses on Private Mode. Ninja helps to open websites in Private mode faster.

## How to use it?

If you click the Ninja icon on the top bar OR Press `ALT + Z`, then the current website will be opened in Private mode. And will be removed from history. So, don't worry.

Or if you want to open a website everytime in Private mode, you can add that website to Private Websites (a option in Ninja).  
To do that, follow these steps

1. Visit the website.
2. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + Z`.
3. From now on, the website will be opened up in a Private window everytime you load that website.

If you want to remove that website from the Private Websites list, follow these steps 1. Right click on Ninja chrome extension icon. 2. Click `Options`. 3. Delete the websites you don't want.
